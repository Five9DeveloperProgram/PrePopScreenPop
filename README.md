###Introduction:
One of the most common questions we are asked about the The Five9 Open CTI Adapter for Salesforce is: "How can I pre-populate fields on a new sObject (Lead/Contact/Account etc.) form at screen pop?" Examples might include: populating a lead phone number field with the caller's ANI, Populating information about the campaign the number the caller called on belongs to, etc. The Five9 Adapter will only screen pop a new blank form when there is no ANI match. This package allows the pre-polulation of form fields from call variables using [URL hacking](http://raydehler.com/cloud/clod/salesforce-url-hacking-to-prepopulate-fields-on-a-standard-page-layout.html).
